                    <h1>Space FooDogs Motion detection</h1>
                    <p>Our hack for the Hackathon is a deployable webcam motion detection software for all OSes and computers.
                    In our current configuration we have both a raspberryPi v2 and a MacBook running the software.</p>

            <h2>How to use?</h2>
            <p1>To use the Software you simply install OpenCV and run our program!</p1>
            <h2>What about the server?</h2>
            <p1>For the server side you don't need anything, just execute our server program and it does the rest, additionally you can host this website as a portal to remotely view the logs! sadly its not very scalable and you will need to manually add a webpage for each camera.</p1>
            <h2>What if I want notifications on the go?<h2>
            <p1>Good news! we can fill you spam folder, Bill Waggoner Style!<br> No seriously though you can add you email to the client side mailing list (see Add Email page) and get an email notifying you about an intrusion as well as an image from when it detected the motion.</p1>
            <h2>What about security?<h2>
            <p1>If you mean the webcam software? then don't worry it will keep you safe from your cat roaming the house. As for the application... the NSA already knows your password and has backdoors for your webcam so whats another person viewing your communication?<p1>
